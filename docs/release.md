This package follows the Stonyx shared release pipeline managed by [stonyx-workflows](https://github.com/abofs/stonyx-workflows).

## Remediation of already-published versions

Registry metadata on versions that are already published is corrected out-of-band,
not through the release pipeline. See
[Deprecation remediation](deprecation-remediation.md) for the current case
(`0.1.0`, which shipped `package/.git/config`) and the runbook for applying it.
